# School of Code - Christmas Project

Task was to make a full stack app.

Chose to have a heroku hosted DB, node server (using express), JavaScript, RESTful API with CRUD, 

App allows creation of new craft projects, and searching for projects using name, status etc.

Had fun playing with this to make from start to finish solo, and testing out some CSS.
